Iteration 2
Coder's action: You are an experienced Python coder tasked with solving a data science problem efficiently. Your objective is to:
            1. Handle any missing or inconsistent data by applying appropriate imputation or removal methods.
            2. Ensure that any outliers (e.g., sales exceeding 100000USD) are properly identified and dealt with.
            3. Create two visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: 
                - Sales per state.
                - Sales per month.
            4. Write clean and well-documented code. Use comments and docstrings to explain your approach and logic.
        Focus on writing robust, maintainable code that fulfills the problem description with clarity and efficiency. Ensure that edge cases, such as missing values and outliers, are handled properly, and the visualizations are meaningful and accurate.

Reviewer's action: You are a minimalist reviewer. Your mission is to review the following code in the shortest and simplest way 
        that accomplishes the given task without sacrificing clarity or functionality.

Static Analysis (Ruff):
Ruff Error: 

Execution Results:
Code executed successfully.

Reviewer Feedback:
I'll provide you with a detailed review of the given code.

**Data Analysis (16/20)**

* The data analysis is clear and thorough.
* It identifies outliers by using z-score for numerical columns like Price and outlier detection is done using 3 standard deviations.
* It also removes null values from columns that don't require it, which is a good practice to avoid missing data.
* However, the code could be more concise. For example, instead of creating two separate functions for outlier removal and missing value replacement, you can combine them into one function.

**Adherence to PEP-8 (17/20)**

* The use of good naming practices is mostly correct. However, variable names like 'file_name' could be more descriptive.
* The code follows most PEP-8 rules, but some minor adjustments are needed, for example, using uppercase 'C' instead of lowercase in 'csv_file'.

**Code Logic and Structure (18/20)**

* The code logic is clear and efficient. It uses the pandas library to load and clean the data, which makes it easy to follow.
* However, the main function could be more concise. For example, you can use a loop instead of multiple if-else statements.

**Code Comments (8/10)**

* There are some comments in the code that explain what each section does, but they're not very detailed.
* It would be helpful to have comments explaining why certain decisions were made and how they impact the overall logic.

**Visualizations (9/10)**

* The two visualizations are clear and easy to understand. They show sales per state by month, which is a useful summary of the data.
* However, the code could be more concise. Instead of creating two separate functions for plotting, you can combine them into one function.

**Error Prevention (9/10)**

* The code checks if the file exists before trying to load it, which prevents an error from being raised.

**Code Optimization (11/10)**

* Some parts of the code could be optimized. For example, instead of creating two separate functions for outlier removal and missing value replacement, you can combine them into one function.
* The use of pandas' built-in functions like `mean()` and `count()` would also reduce the number of lines in the code.

**Overall Score (16/20)**

The code is well-structured, readable, and efficient. However, it could benefit from some minor improvements in adherence to PEP-8, code logic, comments, visualizations, error prevention, and code optimization.
